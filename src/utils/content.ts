      `Creative Nudge Press was born from a deeply personal understanding of literature's transformative power. Growing up between Mumbai, Singapore, and the United States, our founder Karina Vunnam experienced firsthand how stories can bridge worlds, build resilience, and illuminate paths forward`,
      `"Books were my constant companions during times of profound change," Karina shares. "From reading on the streets of Mumbai to discovering Project Gutenberg's treasures, I found that great literature has no boundaries—it speaks to the universal human experience while celebrating our unique journeys."`,
      `This belief in the democratization of reading shaped Creative Nudge Press's core mission. Through her journey from the streets of Mumbai to Stanford University, Karina witnessed how access to education and literature can transform lives. As both a software developer and publisher, she works to make meaningful stories accessible to all children, believing that every young reader deserves to see themselves in books while discovering worlds beyond their own.`,
